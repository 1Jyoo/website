I am a graduate student majoring in Smart City with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and blockchain-based energy systems. My interests lie in integrating AI, BIM, and decentralized technologies to create efficient, transparent, and sustainable urban infrastructures. I am currently developing a P2P Energy market that connects BIM data with a hybrid blockchain system to enable peer-to-peer energy trading.
