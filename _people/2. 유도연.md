I am an undergraduate student majoring in Smart City with a double major in Artificial Intelligence.
I am interested in integrating AI technologies into building and energy systems to create sustainable and efficient urban environments.
Currently, I am conducting research on measuring and optimizing building energy efficiency using Building Information Modeling (BIM) and EnergyPlus.
