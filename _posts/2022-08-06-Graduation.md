### Successfully finished my Ph.D. degree.

I successfully defended my dissertation on May 17, 2022, and officially graduated on August 6, 2022. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Mark J. Clayton, and all committee members (Drs. Robert D. Brown, Wei Yan, Liliana O. Beltran) for their invaluable insight, guidance, critique, and support throughout the process. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to the next chapter in my academic journey. Thank you all.
